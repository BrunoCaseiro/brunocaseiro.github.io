## $whoami

Hey there, my name is Bruno Caseiro and I am a security engineer specialized in offensive security and pentesting. If you are unfamiliar with the term, think about Defence Against the Dark Arts but for computers. I get to legally ⁽ᵐᵒˢᵗ ᵒᶠ ᵗʰᵉ ᵗᶦᵐᵉ⁾ hack things! @fbi just kidding 


## About this blog

Here I'll be posting about some of my experiences, interesting vulnerabilities I find, topics I have a strong opinion on or anything in between. It's a laid back, informal space to talk a bit about what I am doing. I'm also aiming to make this understandable to anyone even remotely close to the cybersecurity world.

An intelligent person isn't one who can throw around a lot of extremely technical terms, but one who actually makes himself understood.

Finally, what's with the avatar on the left? Well, many people compare pentesting to black magic, so I decided to let a cute, tiny, red teaming wizard lead the way on this website.


## Other interests

I have many interests beside security, we are more than what we do for a living. Next time someone asks "what do you do?", start with what's most interesting to you! I'm probably sticking to cybersecurity though, it's fun to tell people I'm a hacker 😄 Anyway, here are some of my other interests.


### Learning languages

I'm a native Portuguese speaker and have been exposed to English since I was a kid. Spanish runs in my (part latino) family, so I've dedicated some time to perfect it. I can understand German, my writing and speaking is still kind of bad, but I'm working on it! I'm also familiar with the very basics of French and Italian and they're next on my language pipeline.

I currently have a +1800 day Duolingo streak 🔥🦉, but most of my progress comes from reading/listening to native material as well as studying vocabulary with flashcards.


### Sports, Fitness and Health

I played basketball for many years, so naturally I love sports even though I don't do a good job of following them. I go to the gym a lot but I used to do calisthenics only. I still do, but to a lesser degree. It's like strength training without too much equipment, think pull ups and dips, usually with heavy weights attached to myself.

Besides that, I stick to a very healthy and active lifestyle. I do have a cheat day ~~twice per hour~~ occasionally, but most of the time you'll see me drinking water and eating clean foods.


### Listening

I'm sorry, I'm stuck in the 2000s. If you ask me to DJ, you'll have to listen to Blink-182, Sum 41, Avril Lavigne and the like. I enjoy other genres, but that's the main one.

Besides music, I love podcasts. My favorite is Darknet Diaries, hands down! I also listen to podcasts in other languages about random topics - I get to explore things I'm genuinely interested in while working towards my language learning goals.


### Other boring stuff

You will find this sentence in every blog in the world. I like cars and F1, going out, watching TV shows, going to the movies, reading (I like my Kindle more than my Google Pixel 🤓), traveling, etc... But I'll add a different twist: traveling alone. It's super liberating and it feels like bringing out the true personality inside of you. Go ahead and try it out sometime!
