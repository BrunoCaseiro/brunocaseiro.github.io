## Pentesting cloud environments

It seems there aren't many resources on cloud pentesting, so I decided to take matters into my own hands, focusing on AWS. I won't create any new learning material, instead I'll aggregate the best free resources I can find. Any CTFs or practical exercises I complete will be documented, as well as any notes I take on theoretical material.

I'll update this page continuously and share it when I'm satisfied with it so it can be useful to someone out there. At the moment this post is still in development and I have not gone through all of this material, I may add or remove stuff in the future and cannot vouch for their quality yet.

### The plan

* Introductory material
  * <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/intro-cloud-pentesting">Introduction to Cloud Pentesting</a>
  * <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/aws-pentesting-guide">AWS penetration testing</a>

* Usefull cheatsheets:
  * <a href="https://github.com/kh4sh3i/cloud-penetration-testing">kh4sh3i's Cloud pentesting cheatsheet</a>
  * <a href="https://cloud.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html">HackTricks Cloud</a>

* CTFs and hands-on material
  * <a href="http://flaws.cloud/">flaws.cloud</a>
  * <a href="https://pwnedlabs.io/">pwnedlabs.io</a>
  * <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/fortresses/7">HTB Fortress: AWS</a>
  * <a href="https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat"> CloudGoat 2.0</a>
